# 🎉 Fun Calculator 🎉

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator** — a simple Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations in a fun and beginner‑friendly way! 😎✨

This mini project is perfect if you're learning Python and want to practice:

* Taking user input
* Working with numbers (including decimals)
* Performing basic math operations
* Printing formatted results

---

## 🧮 What Does It Do?

The program asks the user to enter **two numbers** and then calculates:

* ➕ **Addition (Sum)**
* ➖ **Subtraction (Difference)**
* ✖️ **Multiplication (Product)**
* ➗ **Division (Quotient)**

All calculations support **decimal numbers** using `float()`.

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Python **3.x** installed on your computer

(No extra libraries needed 🎉)

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Program

1. Save the Python code in a file, for example:

   ```bash
   calculator.py
   ```

2. Open your terminal or command prompt

3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

4. Enter the two numbers when prompted ✨

---

## 📌 Example Output

```text
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2

Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.0
Difference: 8.0
Product: 20.0
Quotient: 5.0
```

---

## ⚠️ Note

* Make sure the **second number is not zero** when dividing, otherwise Python will raise an error.

---

## 🚀 Learning Outcomes

By building this calculator, you practice:

* Using `input()` and `float()`
* Performing arithmetic operations
* Writing clean and readable Python code
* Understanding program flow step by step
